Block Builder

Version: 3/9/15

Authors: Alix McCabe, Kathryn Hite

Description: This pygame is an interactive block builder where the user can move and place building blocks
                    within the game by moving a blue object in front of the camera to represent the position 
                    of the block they are placing.  This game works best when played in an area where there is
                    limited blue in the backround.

Run: To run this game, execute 'python block_buiilder.py' in the interactive_programming directory while holding 
	a blue object in front of your computer's camera.  To play the game, move the building blocks around the
	screen by moving the blue object in front of the camera.  To place a block press the spacebar.  A new
	block will be automatically generated.
